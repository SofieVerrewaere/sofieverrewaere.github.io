<p>In this paper, we compare three different trotting techniques and five different turning strategies on a 
small, compliant, biologically inspired quadrupedal robot, the Oncilla. The locomotion techniques were optimized on the actual hardware using a treadmill setup, without relying on models. We found that using half ellipses as foot trajectories resulted in the fastest gaits, as well as the highest robustness against parameter changes. Furthermore, we analyzed the importance of using the scapulae for turning, from which we observed that although not necessary, they are needed for turning with a higher speed.</p>
