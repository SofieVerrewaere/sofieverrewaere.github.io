The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation" target="_blank">Santander Product Recommendation data science competition</a> where the goal was to predict which new banking products customers were most likely to buy has just ended. After my earlier success in the <a href="https://ttvand.github.io/Winning-approach-of-the-Facebook-V-Kaggle-competition/" target="_blank">Facebook recruiting competition</a> I decided to have another go at competitive machine learning by competing with over 2,000 data scientists. This time I finished 2nd out of 1785 teams! In this post, Iâ€™ll explain my approach.
