The [Facebook V: Predicting Check Ins data science competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-v-predicting-check-ins) where the goal was to predict which place a person would like to check in to has just ended. I participated with the goal of learning as much as possible and maybe aim for a top 10% since this was my first serious Kaggle competition attempt. I managed to exceed all expections and finish 1st out of 1212 participants! In this post, Iâ€™ll explain my approach.
