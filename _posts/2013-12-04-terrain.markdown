<p>Using data retrieved from the Puppy II robot at the University of Zurich (UZH), we show that machine 
learning techniques with non-linearities and fading memory are effective for terrain classiﬁcation, both 
supervised and unsupervised, even with a limited selection of input sensors. The results indicate that most 
information for terrain classiﬁcation is found in the combination of tactile sensors and proprioceptive joint 
angle sensors. The classiﬁcation error is small enough to have a robot adapt the gait to the terrain and hence 
move more robustly.</p>
